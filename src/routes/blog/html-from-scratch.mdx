## Why does HTML look like that and how does it actually work?

We'll answer that question by going through the problems that HTML was designed to solve, while also designing our own HTML from scratch.

This article is meant for aspiring web developers that are starting out with learning HTML.

I'm a researcher from 1993. I want to write a document and put it up on this thing called the internet.

I wrote my document in Microsoft Word and I want to share it with the world.

I'm a browser from 1993. I don't care about Microsoft Word. 

I want to display simple documents that anyone can write in any text editor.

## First design

Let's break down the first requirements that came up when HTML was first conceived.

> Disclaimer: I didn't even bother googling how HTML was created. 
  This is a revisionists history for the purpose of learning HTML, not what actually went down.

Users wanted:
- To share documents with other people
- To format their documents with the usual text formatting options: **Headings, Bold, Italics, Images**

Browser developers wanted:
- An accessible format that could be authored in any plain text editor
- A way to link from one document to another
- A format that is easy for machines to understand
- For people to use their browsers


Let's go through each requirement and let that guide us into designing how HTML would work.

### File formats

What is a file format? 

At the deepest depths of a computer, everything is represented using numbers (in binary form).

The letter `A` has the number `65` associated with it for example. 

When the computer program reads a file and it's expecting to be reading alphabetical characters, when it sees `65` it will "know" that that is the letter `A`. 

A file containing `65` and `66` would be read as `AB`:

<PostImage src="/images/html-from-scratch/65-66-to-AB.png" alt="Visualization of a file containing 65 and 66 being turned into AB"/>

That's how `.txt` files work. And most other files types that you can open in Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac OS.


But many other files types out there don't work like this. 

You can write a program that saves the letters `AB` to the disk as `01`. As long as you also write a program that will
