title: Syncing solid-js resources to a global store
---

Solid provides a createResource function that gives you a few niceties out of the box for working with async data.

Stuff like:

- automatic refetching on reactivity changes
- signals for checking if the data is loading
- and of course, Suspense.

Suspense can't be triggered any other way, so most solid apps are going to be using resources extensively.

The drawback is that createResource pushes you into a pattern of data locality, where the data is only being used in the component that defined the resources (or it's children).

> Data locality is nice until it isn't

Most complex web-apps make use of a global state, and tying data management and fetching to components makes it clunky to properly sync data between global and local.

A naive first approach for achieving this syncing might look like this:
