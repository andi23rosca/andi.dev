◊title{How my open source package landed me a job}

This post is part reflection on what has happened, part advice on how you could leverage your own open source contributions to do the same.

But, the advice part of this post should first be prefaced with a big: ◊bold{IT'S MOSTLY DOWN TO LUCK}.
I do think there are ways to maximize that luck though.
