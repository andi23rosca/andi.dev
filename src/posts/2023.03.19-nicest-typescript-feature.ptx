§title{The nicest typescript feature you'll (almost) never need}

I've been working on §link({url: "https://github.com/andi23rosca/solid-leaflet"}){solid-leaflet} in my spare time and ran into a pretty curious type problem.

§aside{leaflet js is a interactive map library that I've been trying to integrate into solid's reactivity and component system}

Leaflet has its own classes for managing different types of UI bits inside the map.

There is a §inline{Map} instance that handles the map pane, a §inline{Marker} class to add pins on the map, a §inline{Popup} class to render popups, etc.

Most of these should be translated from class instances to solid components.

§layout{
  §column({size: "50%"}){
    From this:
    §code({lang: "typescript"}){
      const map = new Map();
      const marker = new Marker();
      marker.addTo(map);
    }
  }
  §column({size: "50%"}){
    To this:
    §code({lang: "tsx"}){
      <Map>
        <Marker />
      </Map>
    }
  }
}
