I teach programming in my spare time.

One thing I've noticed that isn't explicitly laid out in most online resources is the difference between code and data. 

It doesn't help that when you learn web development the line is blurred even more with JSX files where half of the file is JS instructions, half of it is "HTML".

Even with plain HTML. It's a data format, but it also "lives" as the interactive DOM in a browser page. 
When you don't know how the browser works yet those 2 concepts can very easily just blend together under one "this is how HTML works" umbrella in your mind.

I've always appreciated articles that build up knowledge from scratch, building on fundamental concepts one on top of another until it becomes obvious why things are the way they are. This is my attempt to do the same.



## How computers store data

At the deepest depths of a computer, everything is represented as numbers (in binary form).
